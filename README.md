# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Prediction
The aim of this project is to build and train machine learning models using PySpark MLlib by implementing algorithms such as Logistic Regression and RandomForest Classifier to evaluate the model using test dataset and other metrics
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset to get the better visualization of the data using basics of SQL
Improved the modelâ€™s accuracy upto 80% and precision upto 70% by using a standard pipeline to train and test the model
